# ðŸŽ¶ Online Music Streaming

In this guided machine learning project, I learn how to create and train a model called a music recommender which suggests music genre based on the user profile. 

In this case, the feature names are age and gender which we use to predict the music genre that a user would like.

### Output
1. Python script on Jupyter Notebook: [Online Music Streaming.ipynb](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Online-Music-Streaming/blob/main/Online%20Music%20Streaming.ipynb)
2. Music recommender (trained model): [Music recommender.joblib](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Online-Music-Streaming/blob/main/music-recommender.joblib)
3. Decision Tree diagram: [music recommender.dot](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Online-Music-Streaming/blob/main/music-recommender.dot) - Open using VS Code
